### About
We built an application that simplifies the process of signing up for a credit card.
By analyzing a Capital One bank account owner's previous transaction history, we judge which
credit card will work best for them. Should the user not have an account, we can judge, based on 
the user's income, debt, and location's cost of living, what sort of credit card would work for them.
